1) Created the file ann_wrap.py, which also includes imports from cffi_code.py
    - This wraps the code necessary to load the C interface making a one line call:
        from cffi_code import *
      possible in python.  Cleans up the interface with other code.  
    - Tested this by trying the simple code from cffi_test.py and it works.
2) Modified cffi_code.py so that it automatically parses the C interface from the ann.h file.
3) Added the ability to define the weights of connections to ann.h and ann.cpp
4) Added a few test cases to ensure functionality of the wrapper at the most basic level.
5) Dumping to string and reloading works.

TODO Next: Start working towards Evolutionary Operator implementation.
